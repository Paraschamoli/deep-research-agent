  overview: |
    This skill performs comprehensive research using structured methodology.
    It discovers relevant sources, validates credibility, synthesizes findings,
    and provides properly formatted citations. Designed for academic,
    professional, and strategic research requiring evidence-backed outputs.

  use_cases:
    when_to_use:
      - "Academic research with citation requirements"
      - "Market and competitive analysis"
      - "Technology trend analysis"
      - "Policy and regulatory research"
      - "Scientific literature review"
      - "Evidence-based business intelligence"

    when_not_to_use:
      - "Simple factual lookup"
      - "Real-time breaking news"
      - "Personal opinion generation"
      - "Mathematical calculations"
      - "Code generation or debugging"

  input_structure: |
    Accepts research queries in plain text or structured JSON.

    Example (Plain Text):
    "Research recent advancements in quantum computing error correction"

    Example (JSON):
    {
      "query": "Research topic",
      "depth": "quick|standard|comprehensive",
