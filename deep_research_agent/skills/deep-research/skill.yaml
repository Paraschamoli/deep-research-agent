    - "Complex query timeout: Returns intermediate results with completion status"
    - "Schema validation error: Falls back to standard structured output"
    - "API limitations: Queues research or suggests simplifying query"
    - "Conflicting information: Presents multiple perspectives with source credibility"

  examples:
    - title: "Market Trends Research"
